<h2>About us</h2>
<p>Waffle Puns was established in 2013 by Clara Winborn and Leslie Woods. They started this restaurant with the hopes of created a fun spot to hang out with friends or family. While also providing delicious food with a comedic twist
With Clara's passion for food and Leslie's passion for people it became the perfect combination. Leslie and Clara had been friends for 3 years before they created Waffle Puns. Since then the rest has been history. So if you're ever in the mood for some good food whether savory or sweet stop on by! You'll be sure to leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face.</p>
